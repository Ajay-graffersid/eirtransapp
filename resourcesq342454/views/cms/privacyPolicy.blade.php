		<h2>10. Your rights</h2>
		<p>The following section explains your rights. The various rights are not absolute, and each is subject to certain exceptions or qualifications.</p>

		<p>We will grant your request only to the extent that it follows from our assessment of your request that we are allowed and required to do so under data protection laws. Nothing in this Privacy Statement is intended to provide you with rights beyond or in addition to your rights as a data subject under data protection laws.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-font">1. The right to be informed</h3>
		<p>You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Privacy Statement.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-font">2. The right of access</h3>
		<p>You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal information (if we’re processing it), and other certain information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Statement) about how it is used.</p>

		<p>This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your personal information in accordance with data protection law.</p>

		<p>We can refuse to provide information where to do so may reveal personal information about another person or would otherwise negatively impact another person’s rights.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-font">3. The right to rectification</h3>
		<p>You can ask us to take reasonable measures to correct your personal information if it’s inaccurate or incomplete. E.g. if we have the wrong date of birth or name for you.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-font">4. The right to erasure</h3>
		<p>This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your personal information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep using it or its use is unlawful. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions, e.g. where we need to use the information in defence of a legal claim.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-font">5. The right to restrict processing</h3>
		<p>You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your personal information when we are assessing a request for rectification or as an alternative to erasure. When processing is restricted, we can still store your personal information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their personal information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-font">6. The right to data portability</h3>
		<p>You have rights to obtain and reuse certain personal information for your own purposes across different organisations. This enables you to move, copy or transfer your personal information easily between our IT systems and theirs (or directly to yourself) safely and securely, without affecting its usability. This only applies to your personal information that you have provided to us that we are processing with your consent or to perform a contract which you are a party to (such as pay and compensation services), which is being processed by automated means.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-font">7. The right to object</h3>
		<p>You have the right to object to certain types of processing, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time insofar as that processing takes place for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Eirtrans Logistics Ltd or by a third party. We will be allowed to continue to process the personal information if we can demonstrate “compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override [your] interests, rights and freedoms” or we need this for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>

		<p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling), which significantly affects you, subject to some exceptions. Where this is the case, you have the right to obtain human intervention, voice your concerns and to have the decision reviewed.</p>

		<h2>11. Updating this statement</h2>
		<p>We review our privacy practices from time to time. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page for updates to our Privacy Statement. We reserve the right to modify this policy effective seven (7) days after the posting of the revised Privacy Statement.</p>

		<h2>12. Contact us</h2>
		<p>For further information regarding these rights, about this Privacy Statement generally or to make a complaint please contact our Data Protection Officer at. collections@eirtrans.ie; or call us on 01 8612218.</p>

	 	<p>Please provide as much information as possible to help us identify the information you are requesting, the action you are wanting us to take and why you believe this action should be taken.</p>

		<p>Before assessing your request, we may request additional information in order to identify you. If you do not provide the requested information and, as a result we are not in a position to identify you, we may refuse to action your request.</p>

		<p>We will generally respond to your request within one month of receipt of your request. We can extend this period by an additional two months if this is necessary taking into account the complexity and number of requests that you have submitted.</p>
		
		<p>We will not charge you for such communications or actions we take, unless:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>- You request additional copies of your personal data undergoing processing, in which case we may charge for our reasonable administrative costs, or</li>
			<li>- You submit manifestly unfounded or excessive requests, in particular because of their repetitive character, in which case we may either: <br> (a) charge for our reasonable administrative costs; or <br> (b) refuse to act on the request.</li>
		</ul>
